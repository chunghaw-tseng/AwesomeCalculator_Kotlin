# AwesomeCalculator_Kotlin

Android Calculator made in Kotlin.

This calculator was created based on the one from google.
It will do basic calculations such as add, substract, multiply and divide.

## Important notes
1. CalculatorActivity was the first try on making the calculator using lists. (It made it too complicated and the code was too ugly)
2. NewCalculatorActicity much better and easier to understand version. (Final)
